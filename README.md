A simple calculator project for my Object Oriented Development class. The 'Bad Calculator Project' was the submitted source code, which required 5 seperate classes. Subsequently, my teammates and I redesigned the code to include only a single with class, and the calculation code in the main function; this version is named 'Good Calculator Project'.
